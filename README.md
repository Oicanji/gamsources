# gamsources
TCC from System of Internet

Greetings my name is Ignacio also known as Oicanji, I am a student of Systems for internet on the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina in Brazil. In this repo you can find the beginning of my Undergraduate thesis project, utilizing Flask and Javascript for creating a web application for assisting game developers on creating their game resources such as sprites, sound effects and music.

If you like this project, please, help me with a star, and if you want, you can help me with a pull request.

Thanks for read this, and sorry for my bad english, i'm still learning.

First, you need to install the requirements, you can do this with this command:

After this, you need to run the app.py file, you can do this with this command:

Or harever host and port you are using in environment variables...
(optional, server create a env file if not exists)
Speaking of which in environment variables, you need to create a example this in api/, if not exists env, when you run this project, it will create a env file, but you need to change the values, like this:
